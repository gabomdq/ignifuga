0.4.0
=====
* Greenlet has an instance dictionary now, which means it can be
  used for implementing greenlet local storage, etc. However, this
  might introduce incompatibility if subclasses have __dict__ in their
  __slots__. Classes like that will fail, because greenlet already
  has __dict__ out of the box.
* Greenlet no longer leaks memory after thread termination, as long as
  terminated thread has no running greenlets left at the time.
* Add support for debian sparc and openbsd5-sparc64
