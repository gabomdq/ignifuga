rfoo - Fast RPC client/server module.

Version: 1.3.0

rfoo (remote foo) is a fast Python RPC package which can do 160,000 RPC 
calls per second on a regular PC. It includes a fast serialization module 
called rfoo.marsh which extends the Python built in marshal module by 
eliminating serialization of code objects and protecting against bad input. 
The result is a safe to use ultra fast serializer.

Example server code:
> class MyHandler(rfoo.BaseHandler):
>     def echo(self, str):
>         return str
>
> rfoo.InetServer(MyHandler).start()

Example client code:
> c = rfoo.InetConnection().connect()
> Proxy(c).echo('Hello World!')


rconsole - included with rfoo package is a remote Python console with
auto completion, which can be used to inspect and modify namespace of a
running script.

To activate in a script do:
> from rfoo.utils import rconsole
> rconsole.spawn_server()

To attach from a shell do:
$ rconsole

SECURITY NOTE:
The rconsole listener started with spawn_server() will accept any local 
connection and may therefore be insecure to use in shared hosting
or similar environments!
