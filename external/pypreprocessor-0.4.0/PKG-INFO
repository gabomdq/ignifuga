Description: ==============
        pypreprocessor
        ==============
        
        Features
        ========
        - support c-style directives in python
        - can run post-processed code on-the-fly
        - can output to a file
        - can strip all pre-processor data from the output
        - #defines can be set in code prior to processing
        
        Supported Directives
        --------------------
        - #define
        - #undef
        - #ifdef
        - #else
        - #endif
        - #exclude
        - #endexclude
        
        Python Interpreter Compatibility
        --------------------------------
        pypreprocessor itself was originally designed to provide developers
        with a simple solution to write python 2x and python 3x code in the
        same source file so compatibility is a must.
        
        Currently pypreprocessor has been tested and works in:
        - 2.5
        - 2.6
        - 3.0
        - 3.1
        
        2.4 support has been looked into and can easily be made possible if
        users request it.
        
        There are no plans to support earlier versions of python unless
        there is sufficient demand from users.
