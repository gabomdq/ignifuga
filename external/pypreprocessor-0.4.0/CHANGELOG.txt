This file is included for completeness

To see the full changelog for pypreprocessor.py visit:

Why isn't the full changelog included in the release?
1. Maintaining multiple copies of the changelog may result in
 stale/inconsistent/outdated information.
2. It's much easier to maintain the history of a changelog's edits
 by using a wiki. 
3. Release packages should be as small as physically possible
 therefore it doesn't make sense to add a file that grows with
 each release while adding no value to the source.
4. The pypreprocessor wiki itself is revision-controlled under its
 own repository on google code. Therefore, it makes more sense to
 keep all the documentation for the project together in one place.
