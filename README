==About the Ignifuga Game Engine==

Ignifuga is a multi platform 2D engine based in the Python language 
inspired by similar offerings like Cocos2D, Cocos2D for iPhone, and AndEngine. 
All your game logic code along with the engine's and supporting tools is converted to C during the build process, 
and compiled into one big standalone binary for each of the supported platforms 
(please refer to the FAQ for more information). 
The project is currently in the alpha stage of development, so the expected performance may range from 
not even working to attaining consciousness and starting the third world war for all we know. 
For now, we hope that it lives up to its name and it at least doesn't catch fire.

==Why Ignifuga? Who is he/her/it? What's in a name?==

Ignifuga means fireproof in spanish. 
That doesn't explain much, and it has little to do with game engines, I know. 
Ignifuga is also the name of a chicken, Don Primerizo sidekick in my, Â¿dead? long ago, 
attempt at a graphic adventure "La Epopeya de Don Primerizo Lata". 
Also, it's a catchy name, the art was already there, and the Linux OS has a penguin in their logo, 
so don't come here judging me!
